# neopage
A really tool that displays Neofetch data to a web interface

## Dependencies
- `php` -> Any Current version should work
- `neofetch`
- `aha`
- Some webserver that can display PHP


## Bugs

- Floating is not correctly working
- HTML wrapping is still included
- PHP is probably not idiomatic


## Intended features

- I intend for this to be an include file; something that you include on another webpage, so that you can customise it better, but for the mean time, this will make do
- Actually package this up nicely with a makefile to go to default `/var/www/` (technically done but not really)
- Anything you can think of
